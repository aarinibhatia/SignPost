1. Type of operating system you are using to produce this error:
MacOS




2. Version of the Java system you are using (java -version).
Java 12




3. Subdirectory of your Git working directory to use as the current
   directory when compiling and running your program.




4. EXACT sequence of commands that will cause the error you are seeing,
   including anything needed to compile and execute the program.
   It is NOT acceptable to say "any execution of the program fails"; give
   us a specific one.
running puzzletest() fails.



5. What you see when you execute the commands in 4.

My PuzzleTest() is the only test that is failing. I am unsure of where the error is, makeforwardconnections,
makebackwardconnections, connect, connectable, disconnect, or in my initializers itself.

All other tests are running fine, and ive gone through all these functions rigorously for over 3 days and i still
can't figure it out.

What seems to be the problem is that either extendsimple never returns 2, and i get badArgs("no solution found")
from makesolutionunique(), or squares are assigned incorrect sequence numbers and i get
badArgs("sequence number may not be fixed") from setfixedno.
